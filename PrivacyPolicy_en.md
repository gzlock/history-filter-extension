# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 30, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how "History Interceptor" (the "Extension") handles your data. We respect your privacy, and the extension is designed to operate without any data collection or external transmission.

### 1. Data Collection and Processing

The Extension is built with a "Privacy First" philosophy:

* **No Personal Data Collection:** We do NOT collect, record, store, or upload any personally identifiable information, browsing habits, URLs visited, or search queries.
* **No Remote Transmission:** The Extension contains no remote server interfaces (APIs). All logic and filtering are performed locally on your device.
* **No Telemetry or Analytics:** We do not use any tracking codes, telemetry, or third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics).

### 2. Local Data Storage

All configurations and logs generated by the Extension are kept strictly on your local device:

* **Rule Settings:** Your defined intercept rules and patterns are saved locally via the browser's storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
* **Operation Logs:** The interception logs are stored temporarily in the local memory (maximum 100 entries) for debugging purposes. These logs are wiped when the browser is restarted or manually cleared.
* **Syncing:** Unless you have enabled the browser's official account synchronization feature, your configuration data never leaves your current device.

### 3. Permissions Usage

To provide its core functionality, the Extension requires the following permissions:

* **`history`:** Used solely to identify and remove specific history entries that match your user-defined wildcard patterns.
* **`storage`:** Used to save your filtering rules and preferences locally on your machine.

### 4. Third-Party Disclosure

Since no data is collected, no data is sold, traded, or otherwise transferred to any third parties.
